How to use.
Run the code in your Python environment.
Enter player names in the respective text boxes.
Click on the empty boxes in the game board to place the corresponding symbol (X or O).
The game ends when a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all boxes are filled without a winner.

Tkinter (built-in library in Python)

How it works.
The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid of buttons created using Tkinter's Button widget. Clicking on an empty button places the corresponding symbol (X or O) and triggers a function to check if any player has won or if it is a tie. If a player wins, a message box is displayed with the name of the winner. If all buttons are filled without a winner, a message box is displayed indicating a tie.
